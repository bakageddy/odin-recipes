        <ol>
            <li><p>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan
                and fill with water to just below the bottom
                of the steamer. Bring water to boil. Add
                potatoes, cover, and steam until tender, 10
                to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat.

                skillet over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and cook
                until light brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chili peppers,
                curry leaves, and ginger; cook and stir for about 1 minute.
                Add potatoes, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir carefully for about
                5 minutes
                </p></li>
            <li><p>Transfer potatoes toa bowl and aloow to cool,
                about 15 minutes
                </p></li>
            <li><p>Place 1/2 cup flour into a shallow bowl. Combine the remaining
                flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in a large mixing bowl; salt to taste.
                Mix with your hands while gradually adding water. Knead dough until a
                smooth ball forms. Divide into 6 evenly round balls.
                </p></li>
            <li><p>Roll each dough ball into a thick, circular shape. Form the cooled
                potato mixture into 6 round balls and place a potato ball on top
                of each dough circle. Fold all the dough sides over the potato filling
                to cover. Flatten each stuffed dough slightly while dipping both sides
                into the bowl of flour.
                </p></li>
            <li><p>Roll each dough to a thin, circular shape and set a few inches apart on

                oil. Place a stuffed paratha on the hot skillet and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.

                and continue this same porcess for all the parathas. Serve hot.
